# Tableau Metadata Analysis with Python
This repository showcases how to use tableauserverclient module to analyse the Tableau metadata. The main purpose of this repository is to help understand 
which data sources get affected in case of any changes or updates made to underlying tables in data warehouse. Rather than wait for the refresh extracts to fail 
or some stakeholder to come back and report that a particular dashboard is broken, one can be proactive and reach out to owners of the data sources to notify about 
the upcoming changes in data warehouse.

## Usage

1. Download all the files.

2. Create a personal access token on Tableau.

5. Update the '<YOUR_SITE>' with your Tableau site.

6. Run the file and save your results.
